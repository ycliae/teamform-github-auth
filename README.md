## The seed project for the team forming web application

### Pre-requisites

Install git: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

Install node.js and npm: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
Commands to test the installation:

```
git --version
node -v
npm -v
```

### Clone the project

Please clone the repository at GitHub using `git clone` command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hkpeterpeter/teamform-seed
cd teamform-seed
```

### Install Dependencies
 
In this course project, fixed version of key libraries (e.g. AngularJS 1.5.7) are included in `app/lib` folder to avoid discreprency. Other development dependencies (e.g. karma toolkit, http-server...) will be installed separately via:

```
npm install
```

After running this command, a new folder will be created:

* `node_modules` - It contains the npm packages for the necessary tools we need to build and test our web application

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project via a configuration file `package.json`. The simplest way to start this web application is:

```
npm start
```

After that, open a web browser (Google chrome desktop/mobile web browser is recommended) with the following URL: `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

```

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

 We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* all unit test cases should be written inside the folder `app/unit_tests`

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. 
In this course, we will mainly focus on the branch and statement coverage. 
The output files will be stored inside the `app/coverage` folder. 

## Addtional information for COMP3111H students

Besides from web development, COMP3111H team needs to work on a mobile app (iOS and Android). We recommend your team to use Ionic framework [http://ionicframework.com/] (http://ionicframework.com/). Ionic framework is based on AngularJS. Features completed in Angular can be easily ported to Ionic.
